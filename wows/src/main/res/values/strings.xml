    <string name="ca_rating_explanation">Community Assistant Rating is %1$s damage, %2$s kills and %3$s win rate. Baseline is 1000.</string>
    <string name="ca_rating_overall_explanation">The overall Community Assistant Rating is calculated by finding the average CA Rating for each tier then multiplying that with the percentage of games that tier has out of the total amount of games played by the player. The Summation of these numbers gives you the overall CA Rating.</string>
    <string name="ca_rating_reason">Reason for numbers and equation:\n%1$s damage, %2$s kills and %3$s win rate are the numbers used to create a CA Rating for a ship.
        Standard (ship stat / expected ship stat) * stat coef equation. For example: (22000 damage / 20000 expected) * %1$s. Add together damage, kills and win rate amounts and multiply by 1000.\n\n
        Damage and kills are held higher than win rate because a bad team should not affect your Rating.
        Dealing damage and kills are very important to winning a game and until we get accurate data from Wargaming on Capping and Defense points, these will have to do.
        The equation for the Overall CA Rating is calculated by taking the overall rating per tier multiplied by the percentage of that tiers presence in your overall games. This helps prevent stock ships from hurting your overall score and allows for your favorite ships/tiers to outshine other tiers that might bring you down.
        Originally this method was to prevent seal clubbers from gaming the traditional system of overall rating but I did not want to hurt those who just liked lower tiers or were playing lower tiers with other players.
        This method still prevents against this as players tend to require more games at higher tiers to grind to the next tier. But this won\'t hurt those who want to play lower tier games with their favorite ships.</string>
    <!--end of optional area-->

    <!--This one would be nice to have done.-->
    <string name="ca_rating_tl_dr" >TL:DR:\n\nIndividual Ship Community Assistant Rating is %1$s damage, %2$s kills and %3$s win rate. Overall Community Assistant Rating is calculated by the summation of (average CA Rating for Tier) * (number games for Tier / total games). Baseline of 1000.</string>
